# Test Assessment and Strategy for Transaction Migration

**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Purpose**: Assess current test coverage and define testing strategy before migrating to proper double-entry bookkeeping model

## TODO: Pre-Migration Test Implementation

### Phase 1: Data Integrity Tests (CRITICAL - Complete Before Migration)

**READY FOR MIGRATION** 🎉

---

## Executive Summary

**Current State**: ⚠️ INSUFFICIENT test coverage for safe migration
**Recommendation**: Add comprehensive test suite BEFORE starting migration
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks of test development

## Current Test Infrastructure

### ✅ What's Good

1. **Test Framework**: RSpec with Fabrication (modern, well-supported)
2. **Coverage Tool**: SimpleCov configured and reporting to `public/coverage/`
3. **Authentication Helpers**: Sorcery test helpers already integrated
4. **Basic Fabricators**: Account and Transaction fabricators exist with account type variants

## Current Coverage Analysis

### Transaction Model Coverage: ⚠️ ~10% (CRITICAL GAP)

**What's Tested:**
- ✅ `format_date` method
- ✅ Unique hash validation
- ✅ Basic scopes (`in_year`, `in_month_year`)
- ✅ User association

**What's NOT Tested (CRITICAL):**
- ❌ **Account balance calculations** - No tests for `debits()`, `credits()` methods
- ❌ **Double-entry integrity** - No tests verifying debits = credits
- ❌ **Query methods** - None of the 10+ complex SQL class methods tested:
  - `income_by_category`
  - `expenses_by_category`
  - `income_by_account`
  - `cash_spend_by_account`
  - `credit_spend_by_account`
  - `revenues_all_time`
  - `expenses_all_time`
  - etc.
- ❌ **Edge cases** - NULL accounts, zero amounts, negative amounts
- ❌ **Data integrity** - Hash generation, uniqueness enforcement
- ❌ **Transaction types** - Distinguishing expenses vs income vs transfers

### Account Model Coverage: ⚠️ ~5% (CRITICAL GAP)

**What's Tested:**
- ✅ Basic account creation via fabricators

**What's NOT Tested (CRITICAL):**
- ❌ **Account balances** - `credits()`, `debits()`, `credits_monthly()`, `debits_yearly()`
- ❌ **Account types** - Behavior differences between Asset/Liability/Income/Expense
- ❌ **Normal balances** - Assets should have debit balance, Liabilities credit balance
- ❌ **Account hierarchies** - Parent/child relationships if any
- ❌ **Import class filtering** - `importable` scope behavior

### Controller Coverage: ⚠️ ~30% (MODERATE GAP)

**What's Tested:**
- ✅ Basic CRUD operations (index, show, edit, create)
- ✅ Uncategorized transaction filtering
- ✅ Authentication/authorization

**What's NOT Tested:**
- ❌ **CSV Import** - No end-to-end import tests (only unit tests for parsers)
- ❌ **Categorization workflow** - No tests for the categorize action
- ❌ **Search functionality** - Full-text search not tested
- ❌ **Autocategorize** - Complex logic not tested
- ❌ **Split transactions** - Split workflow not tested
- ❌ **Error handling** - Validation failures, edge cases

### Import Parsers Coverage: ✅ ~80% (GOOD)

**What's Tested:**
- ✅ RBC Visa CSV parsing
- ✅ Vancity formats parsing
- ✅ Amount parsing with quotes and commas
- ✅ Date parsing

**What's NOT Tested:**
- ❌ **End-to-end import** - Parser + Controller + Database
- ❌ **Duplicate detection** - Hash collision handling
- ❌ **Error recovery** - Malformed CSV, missing fields

### Integration/Feature Coverage: ⚠️ ~5% (CRITICAL GAP)

**What's Tested:**
- ✅ Basic income page navigation

**What's NOT Tested:**
- ❌ **Complete user workflows**:
  - Import CSV → View uncategorized → Categorize → View reports
  - Create manual transaction → Edit → Delete
  - View account → See transactions → Edit transaction
- ❌ **Cross-controller flows**
- ❌ **JavaScript interactions**
- ❌ **Error handling in UI**

## Critical Tests Needed Before Migration

### Priority 2: Import Workflow Tests (MUST HAVE)

#### 2.1 End-to-End CSV Import

```ruby

    @uncategorized_txn.reload
    expect(@uncategorized_txn.acct_id_dr).to eq(groceries.id)
  end
end
```

### Priority 3: Regression Suite (MUST HAVE)

This suite captures current behavior as a baseline. These tests MUST pass both before and after migration.

```ruby
# spec/models/transaction_regression_spec.rb
describe 'Transaction behavior baseline (pre-migration)', :regression do

  # These tests capture current behavior
  # They MUST pass both before and after the migration

  describe 'Data integrity' do

      10.times do
        Transaction.create!(
          user: user,

      total_credits = user.transactions.sum(:credit)

      expect(total_debits).to eq(total_credits)
    end
  end

  describe 'Report generation' do
    let(:user) { Fabricate(:user) }

    it 'generates consistent expense reports' do
      # Create test data
      bank = Fabricate(:asset, user: user)
      groceries = Fabricate(:expense, name: 'Groceries', user: user)
      utilities = Fabricate(:expense, name: 'Utilities', user: user)

      Transaction.create!(user: user, tx_date: Date.today, acct_id_dr: groceries.id, debit: 100, acct_id_cr: bank.id, credit: 100)
      Transaction.create!(user: user, tx_date: Date.today, acct_id_dr: utilities.id, debit: 50, acct_id_cr: bank.id, credit: 50)

      # Generate report
      results = Transaction.expenses_by_category(user, Date.today.year, Date.today.month)

      # Verify totals
      grocery_total = results.find { |r| r.name == 'Groceries' }.expenses
      utility_total = results.find { |r| r.name == 'Utilities' }.expenses

      expect(grocery_total).to eq(100)
      expect(utility_total).to eq(50)
    end
  end
end
```

## Test Strategy Before Migration

### Phase 1: Establish Baseline (Week 1)

1. **Run SimpleCov** to get current coverage metrics
2. **Write Priority 1 tests** (Data Integrity) - ~20 tests
3. **Write Priority 2 tests** (Import Workflow) - ~10 tests
4. **Write Priority 3 tests** (Regression Suite) - ~15 tests
5. **Verify all tests pass** with current codebase

### Phase 2: Create Test Fixtures (Week 1-2)

1. **Create realistic CSV fixtures** for import testing
2. **Create test database dump** with representative data
3. **Document edge cases** found in production data

### Phase 3: Migration Testing (During Migration)

1. **Keep regression tests passing** at all times
2. **Add new tests** for TransactionEntry model as it's developed
3. **Test data migration** on copy of production database
4. **Verify reports match** before/after migration

- [ ] Categorization workflow tests
- [ ] Duplicate detection tests
- [ ] Regression baseline tests

### Important Gaps

- [ ] Split transaction tests
- [ ] Autocategorize logic tests
- [ ] Search functionality tests
- [ ] Error handling tests
- [ ] Edge case tests (NULL, zero, negative amounts)

### Nice to Have

- [ ] Performance tests for large datasets
- [ ] Concurrent transaction tests
- [ ] Browser compatibility tests (if JS-heavy)

## Test Execution Plan

### Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
bundle exec rspec

# Run only priority 1 tests
bundle exec rspec spec/models/transaction_balance_spec.rb
bundle exec rspec spec/models/transaction_queries_spec.rb
bundle exec rspec spec/models/account_balance_spec.rb

# Run regression suite
bundle exec rspec --tag regression

# Generate coverage report
bundle exec rspec
open public/coverage/index.html

# Run tests and watch for failures
bundle exec guard  # if guard is configured
```

### CI/CD Considerations

Before starting migration:
1. Ensure all tests run in CI
2. Set up test failure notifications
3. Require green build before merging migration PRs
4. Consider staging environment for migration testing

## Success Criteria

Before starting migration, we must have:

- [ ] ≥70% model test coverage (currently ~10%)
- [ ] All query methods tested and passing
- [ ] CSV import workflow tested end-to-end
- [ ] Categorization workflow tested
- [ ] Regression suite established and passing
- [ ] All current tests passing (no broken tests)
- [ ] SimpleCov report generated and reviewed

## Risk Assessment

### Without Adequate Tests

- ⚠️ **HIGH RISK**: Data loss or corruption during migration
- ⚠️ **HIGH RISK**: Reports showing incorrect balances after migration
- ⚠️ **MEDIUM RISK**: Import process breaks silently
- ⚠️ **MEDIUM RISK**: Categorization workflow broken
- ⚠️ **LOW RISK**: Performance degradation undetected

### With Comprehensive Tests

- ✅ **LOW RISK**: Immediate feedback if migration breaks behavior
- ✅ **Confidence**: Can refactor knowing tests will catch issues
- ✅ **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation
- ✅ **Faster development**: Less manual testing needed

## Recommended Action Plan

1. **Week 1**: Write Priority 1 tests (Data Integrity)
2. **Week 2**: Write Priority 2 tests (Import Workflow) + Run full test suite
3. **Week 3+**: Begin migration with test safety net in place

**DO NOT START MIGRATION UNTIL:**
- All Priority 1 tests are written and passing
- All Priority 2 tests are written and passing
- Regression suite is established
- SimpleCov shows >70% model coverage

## Conclusion

Current test coverage is **insufficient for safe migration**. We need 1-2 weeks of focused test development before beginning the database schema migration. This investment will:

1. Prevent data loss
2. Catch regression bugs early
3. Speed up development
4. Provide confidence in refactoring
5. Serve as documentation

**Next Steps**: Review this assessment with the team and commit to writing the identified tests before migration work begins.
